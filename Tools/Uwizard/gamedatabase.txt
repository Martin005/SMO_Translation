Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
From the creators of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil comes the free flowing over-the-top action, extravagant weapons, demonic hair and savage grace of Bayonetta. Play as Bayonetta, a witch with powers beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and face-off against countless angelic enemies, evil forces and giant sized foes in a game of 100% pure and unadulterated all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stage that are a veritable them park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat. Tired of action games that value realism over fun? If so Bayonetta is the perfect cure: an outrageous brawling beat 'em-up as only the Japanese can make them. Take control of Bayonetta the only thing in the game weirder than the monsters. She might be a witch but Bayonetta isn't taking any chances when going into battle, not only does she have two handguns but her stiletto heels are also pistols and she's not above using everything from a rock launcher to a Japanese sword and a whip. But that's only the half of it: dodge an enemy at the last second and you can enter slow motion &quot;witch time&quot;. Or try transforming into a panther or turn Bayonetta's hair into a giant boot - the more complex your attacks the more chances you'll get to use torture combos to really do some damage. After this any other action game will seem tame by comparison.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched:

Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.

Single Player Campaign:

Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.

Multiplayer:

In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.

Squads:

Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.

Extinction:

A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Once banished to Earth, the biggest heroes of the Skylands – the Giants – are back and ready to save the day! Watch as real-world action figures come to life before your very eyes when Skylanders Giants come to Wii U.

Simply plug a special platform called the Portal of Power into your Wii U console, start the game and place one of the Skylanders figures on the portal – then watch as it appears as a playable character in the game!

Assuming the role of a heroic Portal Master, it's your job to lead your Skylanders across the Skylands in an effort to stop the evil KAOS from wreaking havoc. Deciding which Skylander you use any given time, however, is a key component of the gameplay and being able to change characters at any moment simply by swapping figures on the portal is all part of the fun.

Skylanders Giants introduces a range of new Skylanders figures to collect (sold separately), 16 of which are completely new characters to the series. There are also eight special Lightcore figures that not only bring extra benefits to the game, but also light up in real-life when placed on the portal – without the need for batteries!

All Skylanders figures also have the ability to remember what they've done; from the special moves you teach them to the experience they earn, everything done in the game is stored on the figure itself. That means if you take your figures to a friend's house, they'll still be exactly the same as they were in your game and even know exactly who they belong to! And since co-operative gameplay is the order of the day in Skylanders Giants, you'll definitely want your friends to come and join in the fun.

Place any Skylanders Giants figure on the Portal of Power and watch as they come to life in the game as a playable character!

Collect a range of brand new characters and use their unique powers to overcome obstacles and challenges as you play alone or co-operatively with friends

Skylanders Giants figures store experience, special move and progress data and recall it when you place them on another Portal of Power, even if it's in someone else's game!

Compatible with all Skylanders Spyro's Adventures figures – increase your original heroes to level 15 by playing Skylanders Giants with them!

Earth is under attack from an invasion of enormous aliens, and the only thing that can protect the planet is a group of unlikely, yet mighty, heroes with special abilities. Unfortunately, the aliens are too powerful for the heroes to fight individually. They must join forces and work together to defeat their common enemy. These uniquely different

heroes can morph into powerful weapons to crush the invaders or turn into objects like a giant fist or bridge to interact with and traverse the environments.

Players must explore each stage to find helpless citizens and recruit them to join their army of heroes. The more heroes you gather, the greater your Special Morph Powers will be.
Players can use the Wii U GamePad’s touch screen to command heroes such as Bonzai Man, Vending Machine Man and even Toilet Bowl Man. Heroes can also morph into gelatin to guard themselves from enemy attacks.
Players can also use the GamePad to explore areas unseen on the TV screen and solve puzzle elements.

Armed with state-of-the-art technology, top-of-the-line-gadgets, deadly combat abilities and an elite team known as the 4th Echelon, Sam Fisher holds nothing back to get the job done through whatever means necessary to stop the Blacklist countdown before it reaches zero. Splinter Cell Blacklist offers enhanced gameplay options on the WiiU. The Gamepad replicates Sam’s OpSat, allowing the player to operate gadgets such as tri-rotor drones and the sticky cam through touch and motion based inputs. The Wii U GamePad allows for faster reaction times, letting the player mark enemies, switch weapons, quick reload and choose gadgets to adapt to any situation, among other features.

Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stage that are a veritable them park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat. Tired of action games that value realism over fun? If so Bayonetta is the perfect cure: an outrageous brawling beat 'em-up as only the Japanese can make them. Take control of Bayonetta the only thing in the game weirder than the monsters. She might be a witch but Bayonetta isn't taking any chances when going into battle, not only does she have two handguns but her stiletto heels are also pistols and she's not above using everything from a rock launcher to a Japanese sword and a whip. But that's only the half of it: dodge an enemy at the last second and you can enter slow motion &quot;witch time&quot;. Or try transforming into a panther or turn Bayonetta's hair into a giant boot - the more complex your attacks the more chances you'll get to use torture combos to really do some damage. After this any other action game will seem tame by comparison.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched:

Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.

Single Player Campaign:

Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.

Multiplayer:

In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.

Squads:

Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.

Extinction:

A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.

In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.

Squads:

Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.

Extinction:

A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.

This is a colorful and chaotic online third-person action shooter – exclusively on Wii U.

FEATURES:

-Team up and take on other teams in an action-filled battle to cover the level with as much ink as possible. Spray walls to access hard-to-reach areas.

The object of this head-to-head puzzle game is to clear your grid of falling patterns, called puyos, by forming chains of four or more same-colored puyos in a straight line or one of several geometric patterns. What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random piece of filler onto your opponent’s grid. The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent’s grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you’ve won the game. An intriguing backstory makes this an amusing experience for one or two players.

As in Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels, Luigi keeps his higher jumping abilities and his looser traction as he runs for the flag post at the end of each stage. Also to add an extra element of speed each level begins with only 100 seconds on the clock.

In addition to the Luigi and the Yellow and Blue Toads, a fourth character will be available for Multiplayer, Nabbit. Already seen in New Super Mario Bros U, Nabbit was the thieving character that would steal power-ups when met on the world map. Nabbit is invincible to damage from enemies and world dangers such as lava, but you’ll still need to look out for those long drops.

Once banished to Earth, the biggest heroes of the Skylands – the Giants – are back and ready to save the day! Watch as real-world action figures come to life before your very eyes when Skylanders Giants come to Wii U.

Simply plug a special platform called the Portal of Power into your Wii U console, start the game and place one of the Skylanders figures on the portal – then watch as it appears as a playable character in the game!

Assuming the role of a heroic Portal Master, it's your job to lead your Skylanders across the Skylands in an effort to stop the evil KAOS from wreaking havoc. Deciding which Skylander you use any given time, however, is a key component of the gameplay and being able to change characters at any moment simply by swapping figures on the portal is all part of the fun.

Skylanders Giants introduces a range of new Skylanders figures to collect (sold separately), 16 of which are completely new characters to the series. There are also eight special Lightcore figures that not only bring extra benefits to the game, but also light up in real-life when placed on the portal – without the need for batteries!

All Skylanders figures also have the ability to remember what they've done; from the special moves you teach them to the experience they earn, everything done in the game is stored on the figure itself. That means if you take your figures to a friend's house, they'll still be exactly the same as they were in your game and even know exactly who they belong to! And since co-operative gameplay is the order of the day in Skylanders Giants, you'll definitely want your friends to come and join in the fun.

Place any Skylanders Giants figure on the Portal of Power and watch as they come to life in the game as a playable character!

Collect a range of brand new characters and use their unique powers to overcome obstacles and challenges as you play alone or co-operatively with friends

Skylanders Giants figures store experience, special move and progress data and recall it when you place them on another Portal of Power, even if it's in someone else's game!

Compatible with all Skylanders Spyro's Adventures figures – increase your original heroes to level 15 by playing Skylanders Giants with them!

Watch Dogs

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
All it takes is the swipe of a finger. We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what's happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it's not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems.

In Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (ctOS) – and it controls almost every piece of the city's technology and holds key information on all of the city's residents.

You play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy. Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city's network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy…and more.

Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge.

    Hack the City: Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city's infrastructure. Trap your enemy in a 30-car pile-up by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city's ctOS can become your weapon.
    Seamless Multiplayer Experience: Discover new levels of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between players thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single and multiplayer modes into one seamless experience. That means no menus, no loading screens, just instant open world multiplayer action.
    Stay Connected with a New Way to Play: Take your experience beyond the console with a ground breaking, real-time, companion game. This innovative mobile platform allows players to connect and compete with friends, even when away from their home console. The Watch_Dogs companion game delivers revolutionary dual-screen gameplay that enables you to play from anywhere, at any time.
    Street Justice: Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons.
    High Octane: With help from Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series, Watch_Dogs offers a stable bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state-of-art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions.
    Everything is Under Control: Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city.
    Dynamic Navigation: Watch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the city's ctOS to your advantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through one of the buildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
The Witch is Back.

The witching hour strikes again. Brimming with intricate battles that take place in, on and all over epic set pieces, Bayonetta 2 finds our sassy heroine battling angels and demons in unearthly beautiful HD. You’re bound to love how it feels to string together combos with unimaginable weapons and to summon demons using Bayonetta’s Wicked Weave in this frantic stylized action game. Bayonetta 2 is a Wii U exclusive. Bayonetta comes packed in with the purchase of every retail packaged version of Bayonetta 2. Nintendo eShop purchases of either Bayonetta or Bayonetta 2 will include an automatic discount on the other game.

Features:

•Initiate the new Umbran Climax technique to temporarily summon demons and boost Bayonetta’s attack power and range whenever you fill her magic gauge.
•Fight with new over-the-top weapons that open new possibilities to the way you battle, including the Kafka, a bow that shoots poisonous arrows; the Rakshasa, a pair of beautiful katana blades; and a giant rifle-inspired scythe known as the Chernobog.
•Team up with a friend in Tag Climax, a two-player online co-op mode. Enjoy a little friendly competition by trying to deal the most damage as you work together to take down angels and demons.
In online quick matches, you can wager halos, the in-game currency that you earn by defeating enemies. You receive a large sum back if you can prove you’re a better fighter than your partner. Halos can then be traded in a story mode shop to unlock new techniques, buy accessories and pick up alternate weapon variations.
•Every chapter ends with a medal ranking: Stone, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum or Pure Platinum. The more skilled you are, the higher your ranking.
•This game is approachable for players of all levels, with settings of three difficulty levels. Through Touch Play, you can play with the GamePad stylus and touch screen, regardless of which difficulty you choose.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
In this climactic sequel to the critically acclaimed Bayonetta action game, players will be on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Brimming with jaw-dropping battles and gorgeous cut scenes, this game never lets up on the action. Fight on top of a jet as it soars through a downtown city. Duke it out against a giant angelic monster with a deadly whip-like arm on top of a speeding train. And take to the skies in a fight against a demonic dragon while ascending to the top of a skyscraper.
The witch is back.
Born of a forbidden union between the Lumen Sages and the Umbra Witches, the mighty witch Bayonetta travels from the distant past to the present day. With her graceful fighting style and peerless magical powers, she captivates and terrifies her opponents in their final moments.
Armed with new weapons and abilities, Bayonetta has her enemies baffled by her new moves and torture attacks. Using magic, she can unleash a new ability called Umbran Climax to summon demonic monsters and deliver mighty attacks repeatedly.
Choose between Classic and Touch play styles. The Classic Controls represent the technical control scheme unique to Bayonetta, an acclaimed control scheme that fans of the previous game love and all action game fans will enjoy. The Touch Controls, on the other hand, offer a more convenient play style for those unfamiliar with action games or simply looking for a new spin on action. Players can use the Wii U GamePad touch screen controls to easily manipulate Bayonetta as she moves, attacks and evades enemies.
Bayonetta’s longtime friend and fellow Umbra Witch, Jeanne, appears to assist Bayonetta in performing combination attacks and in doling out intense punishment against enemies. You can even take all the action off the big screen and enjoy off-TV play using the Wii U GamePad.
Take the fight online.
Join forces with a friend to fight through waves of enemies in the online multiplayer Tag Climax mode. Choose from a range of powerful characters, and give angels and demons a beating that's as brutal as it is beautiful.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
From the creators of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil comes the free flowing over-the-top action, extravagant weapons, demonic hair and savage grace of Bayonetta. Play as Bayonetta, a witch with powers beyond the comprehension of us mere mortals and face-off against countless angelic enemies, evil forces and giant sized foes in a game of 100% pure and unadulterated all-out action. Outlandish finishing moves are performed with balletic grace as Bayonetta flows from one fight to another. With magnificent over-the-top action taking place in stage that are a veritable them park of exciting attractions, Bayonetta pushes the limits of the action genre, bringing to life its fast-paced, dynamic climax combat.Tired of action games that value realism over fun? If so Bayonetta is the perfect cure: an outrageous brawling beat &quot;em-up as only the Japanese can make them. Take control of Bayonetta the only thing in the game weirder than the monsters. She might be a witch but Bayonetta isn&quot;t taking any chances when going into battle, not only does she have two handguns but her stiletto heels are also pistols and she&quot;s not above using everything from a rock launcher to a Japanese sword and a whip. But that&quot;s only the half of it: dodge an enemy at the last second and you can enter slow motion &quot;witch time&quot;. Or try transforming into a panther or turn Bayonetta&quot;s hair into a giant boot - the more complex your attacks the more chances you&quot;ll get to use torture combos to really do some damage. After this any other action game will seem tame by comparison.

Call of Duty: Ghosts
USA


Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Outnumbered and Outgunned, but Not Outmatched:

Call of Duty: Ghosts is an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise’s new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.

Single Player Campaign:

Ten years after a devastating mass event, America’s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what’s left of the nation’s Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as “Ghosts” leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty before.

Multiplayer:

In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don’t just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks in Call of Duty: Ghosts - such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike. Players can even bring in guard dog Riley, from the single-player campaign, to protect and also to attack enemies. There are also over 30 NEW weapons, including an entirely new weapon class: Marksman Rifles.

Squads:

Build your team and take up to 6 of them into battle in the all new Squads mode. This mode takes the best parts of the multiplayer experience and allows you to play either solo or cooperatively with the custom soldiers created and leveled up in multiplayer. The load-out choices you make for your Squad members will directly change the AI behavior of your squad-mates. Give your soldier a sniper rifle and he’ll behave like a sniper, and an SMG guy will be more run and gun.

Extinction:

A completely new one to four player, co-op game mode featuring a unique blend of fast-paced survival gameplay, base defense, player customization and class leveling. Teamwork and communication are essential when playing Extinction, as your team faces an inhuman menace that has overrun an isolated Colorado town and you must eliminate the threat via any means necessary.

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
Wir schreiben das Jahr 2025 und du befindest dich in der nahen Zukunft auf einer Mission zur Rettung der Welt. In „Call of Duty: Black Ops II“ für Wii U erwarten dich spannende grafische Umgebungen und ein episches Einzelspieler-Abenteuer!

Zum ersten Mal in der Serie verzweigt sich dein Abenteuer in verschiedene Handlungsstränge, in denen sich deine Entscheidungen auf deine aktuelle Mission auswirken. Zudem haben deine Erfolge oder Misserfolge Einfluss auf die Gesamtstruktur der Geschichte. Diese dynamischen Missionen deiner Einsatztruppe ermöglichen es dir, eine Reihe unterschiedlicher Objekte zu steuern, darunter auch Kampfjets, unbemannte Drohnen und sogar Roboter. Dein Fortschritt könnte sich sogar auf die Pläne deines Gegenspielers, des finsteren Raul Menendez auswirken.

„Call of Duty: Black Ops II“ nutzt die fortschrittlichsten Texturen, Beleuchtungs- und Schattierungseffekte in der Geschichte der Serie und wartet mit einer atemberaubenden HD-Erfahrung auf. Über den einzigartigen zweiten Bildschirm auf dem Wii U GamePad können Spieler die Action hautnah miterleben. Der Touchscreen des GamePads kann zudem zur Anzeige von Mehrspieler-Landkarten, dem Einsammeln von Score-Streaks und der Auswahl von Ausrüstung verwendet werden.

Im Mehrspielermodus lernst du einige der modernsten Ausrüstungsgegenstände und Waffen von 2025 kennen sowie einen ganz neuen Zombie-Feldzug, der neben der Haupthandlung abläuft. Außerdem erwarten dich neue Modi, die ein noch fesselnderes Gemeinschaftserlebnis ermöglichen. Das Spiel unterstützt bis zu vier Controller, einschließlich Wii-Fernbedienung und Nunchuk, und sorgt so für spannende Mehrspieler-Begegnungen im heimischen Wohnzimmer.

Weitere Mehrspieler-Optionen sind der Klasseneditor (Create-A-Class) und ein neues „Nimm-10-System“ (Pick-10), mit dem unterschiedlichste Klassenkombination möglich sind. Anstatt sich für Inhalte aus den einzelnen Klassen entscheiden zu müssen, kannst du Objekte aus einer Klasse gegen Zusatzobjekte aus einer anderen eintauschen – und mit beliebigen 10er-Kombinationen ist fast alles möglich!

Score-Streaks belohnen dich für die Unterstützung deines Teams auf dem Weg zum Sieg: Das Erobern von Flaggen, die Verteidigung deiner Kameraden mit einem Assault-Shield, das Abschießen von Gegnern und das Unterstützen anderer sind Beispiele dafür, wie du dein Team zum Sieg führen und dein Punktekonto füllen kannst. Im League Play kämpfst du ausgehend von deinem Können gegen andere. Durch eine kleine Anzahl von Gefechten kannst du deine Fähigkeitsstufe etablieren und wirst dann in eine Division von Spielern mit ähnlichem Können eingeteilt. Wenn es dir gelingt, weiterhin zu siegen, wirst du befördert. Durch stetigen Fortschritt kletterst du die Leiter nach oben und erreichst schließlich die hochrangigen Divisionen.

Eine weitere unterhaltsame Funktion ist das „CODcasting“ – dieses ermöglicht es dir, deine Lieblingspartien zu kommentieren. Durch League Play und CODcasting wird „Call of Duty: Black Ops II“ noch aufregender und bietet dir noch dazu die Möglichkeit, eigene Kommentare abzugeben.

Rette die Welt im Jahre 2025 mithilfe futuristischer Technologie vor der Vernichtung und lass dich auf gewagte Missionen ein – in „Call of Duty: Black Ops II“ für Wii U.

    Führe einen epischen Einzelspielerkampf und wähle deinen Weg mit Bedacht

    Erlebe mit der Mehrspieler-Option noch aufregendere Action, einschließlich einer neuen Zombie-Handlung

    Nutze innovative Waffen und Ausrüstung und setzte die Technologie der nahen Zukunft zu deinem Vorteil ein

STEP INTO A WORLD OF ADVENTURE

 
Forget everything you know about The Legend of Zelda games. Step into a world of discovery, exploration and adventure in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a boundary-breaking new game in the acclaimed series. Travel across fields, through forests and to mountain peaks as you discover what has become of the ruined kingdom of Hyrule in this stunning open-air adventure.

Features:

Explore the wilds of Hyrule any way you like - Climb up towers and mountain peaks in search of new destinations, then set your own path to get there and plunge into the wilderness. Along the way, you'll battle towering enemies, hunt wild beasts and gather ingredients for the food and elixirs you'll need to sustain you on your journey.
More than 100 Shrines of Trials to discover and explore - Shrines dot the landscape, waiting to be discovered in any order you want. Search for them in various ways, and solve a variety of puzzles inside. Work your way through the traps and devices inside to earn special items and other rewards that will help you on your adventure.
Be prepared and properly equipped - With an entire world waiting to be explored, you'll need a variety of outfits and gear to reach every corner. You may need to bundle up with warmer clothes or change into something better suited to the desert heat. Some clothing even has special effects that, for example, can make you faster and stealthier.
Battling enemies requires strategy - The world is inhabited with enemies of all shapes and sizes. Each one has its own attack method and weaponry, so you must think quickly and develop the right strategies to defeat them.
amiibo compatibility - Tap the Wolf Link amiibo (sold separately) to make Wolf Link appear in game. Wolf Link will attack enemies on his own and help you find items you're searching for. We will also introduce new the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild series of amiibo at E3 this year.

To restore light to the world, team up with the mysterious creature Midna and embrace the darkness to transform into a divine wolf. Fight through labyrinthine dungeons, survive puzzling traps and meet a cast of characters you’ll never forget in this legendary Zelda™ adventure.

The Legend of Zelda™: Twilight Princess is a critically acclaimed masterpiece, set in a massive world bursting with life—but also shadow. A dark figure from the Twilight Realm has invaded the world of light. As Link™, a farmhand turned cursed beast, join forces with the impish Midna and trusted (albeit unusual) allies to survive a quest that'll take you to the farthest corners of Hyrule and beyond… to the Twilight Realm. This emotional adventure is now on the Wii U™ console with improved visuals and controls—and new challenges. Choose Hero Mode to take 2x normal damage, or tap the Wolf Link amiibo™ figure to unlock the tough Cave of Shadows.

ZombiU

Ziffs Live On Cliffs:
ZombiU puts players in the middle of London circa 2012, where an outbreak has infected the population, destroying their humanity and turning them into mindless monsters preying on the flesh of the few remaining survivors. This fear-fueled first-person shooter takes all the terror, chaos and tension found in the best of the horror genre and adds original interactive elements, including a unique death mechanic that puts players in the body of a different survivor each time they die, allowing them to track and take down their old, infected characters, recover their equipment and see if they can stay alive just a little bit longer this time.

The delicate balance of the Triforce has been disrupted and Hyrule Kingdom is once again being torn apart by a dark power, this time led by Sorceress Cia.

Heroic Link carves through a huge onslaught of enemies as he executes flashy moves with combat attacks. This also marks the first time that many other iconic characters from The Legend of Zelda franchise are playable for any length of time, including Princess Zelda, Impa, and Midna.

Protect and reclaim recognisable landmarks from multiple games in The Legend of Zelda series, including such classic areas like Hyrule Field and the Palace of Twilight.

Push back armies of classic enemies from The Legend of Zelda, as well as powerful enemies making their debuts in Hyrule Warriors.

Advance the story to unlock new playable characters, each with unique moves and weapon types. Collect Rupees and other useful items to upgrade weapons and craft badges, which players can use to bolster each warrior's abilities.

Command electromagnetic forces as you puzzle your way through an ancient conspiracy in the steampunk-powered platformer, Teslagrad, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U. With no single word of text or dialogue throughout the entire game, Teslagrad keeps its cards very close to its chest: opening in a rain-soaked city, you are a small, nameless boy – a ‘Teslamancer’ – who can manipulate the twin forces of electricity and magnetism. As the last of your kind, explore the mysterious metropolis and, eventually, the Tesla Tower, to discover a terrible truth about a tyrannical king who once ruled the nation.
As you venture through this archaic, European-inspired world, dodging and drubbing its dangerous denizens, be prepared to flex your mental muscles – solve devious puzzles by using your powers to manipulate the environment, including switching the negative or positive charge of blocks and platforms to open up pathways, and reach new areas. Opposite polarity makes the targets attract, whereas similar polarity makes them repel. Give yourself a specific polarity to ride charged energy tubes, floating side-to-side, or circumventing crackling, electrical barriers designed to zap you! Polarise nearby critters, then send them off down small gullies and alcoves in order to affect otherwise-unreachable objects. By the time your reach the first of the hulking, industrial bosses, your electromagnetic prowess will be second nature! Keep pressing on, and pick up new items for more powers, such as a short-distance teleport to span greater gaps, then hunt down enigmatic scrolls that may hold the key to future events. With later puzzles reaching fiendish levels of difficulty, you’ll need to employ trial-and-error to successfully traverse the tower, especially as traps and creatures will do away with you in a single hit! Razor-sharp ingenuity and flawless logic are your sword and shield in this deep, mysterious place.
With over a hundred levels of retro, 2D platforming set in a non-linear world, plus Machiavellian puzzles galore, your mental and physical reflexes will be tested to capacity in Teslagrad, available to download from Nintendo eShop on Wii U.
